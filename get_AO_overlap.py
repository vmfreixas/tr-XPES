#   Atomic orbital overlaps calculated by PySCF and NWChem might differ
# in the phase convenia taken for the basis coefficient, leading to 
# orthogonalization inconsistencies when using molecular orbitals from
# NWChem and atomic orbital overlaps from PySCF. In such case reading
# the atomic orbital overlaps from NWChem is advised. If the atomic
# orbital overlaps are calculated by PySCF anyways, a sign sanity check
# is required. This function reads the standard output from NWChem and
# returns the atomic orbital overlaps. In the NWChem input the printing
# of the atomic orbital overlap matrix has to specified (i.e. 
# "BASIS "ao basis" SPHERICAL PRINT"). In the NWChem standard the
# atomic orbital overlaps are written under the label
# "global array: Temp Over".
